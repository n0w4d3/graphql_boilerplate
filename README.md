This is an example of GraphQL implementation with apollo-server


Like an Express project where we are free to organize all as we want. Many implementations of GraphQL we can do the same!
Here's a suggestion to start with apollo-server. I use pm2 on a computer instance and works like a charm, at apollo documentation have some examples to deployment as service.
